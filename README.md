## üíª About the project

The Gitignore Creator is a Python utility that allows you to generate .gitignore files for specific development environments or languages by fetching data from the [toptal.com API](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignor).

In software development, a `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. These files typically include temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information like API keys. Managing a `.gitignore` file can be challenging, especially when working on different projects with different requirements. The Gitignore Creator simplifies this process by automating the generation of `.gitignore` files tailored to your project's needs.

## üöÄ How to run the project

You can use the Gitignore Creator as a command-line tool. Here's how to set it up:

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open your terminal and install the Gitignore Creator with pip3 by running the following command:

```BASH
pip3 install .
```

### Generating .gitignore Files

Once installed, you can generate a `.gitignore` file for your specific development environment or language by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Run the Gitignore Creator by typing the following command:

```BASH
gitignore-creator TYPE
```

Replace `TYPE` with the desired development environment or language. For example: `gitignore-creator Node`

3. The Gitignore Creator will fetch the appropriate `.gitignore` template and create a file named `.gitignore` in the current directory.

That's it! You now have a customized `.gitignore` file tailored to your project's needs.
